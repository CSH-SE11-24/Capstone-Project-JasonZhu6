My website is called Hiveclass, it is an online physical education platform that provides students and teachers access to different sport curriculum. 

My target user is students and teachers. 

The modal and the award page is the features I'm the most proud of. 

If I had more time, I would make the award page more dynamic (more similar to Duolingo). 

One of my accessibility feature it the alt tag on image. 

My award page is implemented based on user research, as they feel less motivated to exercise on their own.
